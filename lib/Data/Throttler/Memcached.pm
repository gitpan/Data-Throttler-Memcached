=head1 NAME

Data::Throttler::Memcached - Memcached-Based Data::Throttler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $t = Data::Throttler::Memcached->new(
    max_items => 10,
    interval  => 60,
    cache     => {
      data  => '127.0.0.1:11211', # optional
  );
  
  $t->try_push( 'foo' );
  $t->try_push( key => 'foo' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Data::Throttler does a good job throttling data for you, but unfortunately
it's not distributed -- that is, since the storage is in memory, if you have
a system with multiple hosts, throttling will be done individually on each 
host.

To workaround this limitation, Data::Throttler::Memcached uses 
Cache::Memcached::Managed to store the actual data.

=head1 CAVEATS

There's no locking mechanism when checking/incrementing counts. This means
that each process could possibly overwrite another's value -- but since
throttling is something that isn't "exact", I'm not considering this to be
such a big issue.

We may in the future work around this problem by utilizing distributed locks
like KeyedMutex. Patches welcome.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new instance of Data::Throttler::Memcached.
Accepts the same arguments as Data::Throttler, plus the "cache" argument.

The cache argument must be a hashref, which contains the arguments passed
to the cache backend. For example, if you wanted to change the data server,
you can specify it like so:

  cache => {
    data => 'my.data.host:11211'
  }
